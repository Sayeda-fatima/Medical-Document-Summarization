Chief Complaint: Visual hallucinations Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: N/A History of Present Illness: male with disease dyslipidemia and a history of prostate cancer s/p prostatectomy who was referred to the ED by his neurologist for worsening gait falls and visual hallucinations. The following history is taken from chart review: The patient was seen by his neurologist on at which time he was noted to have visual hallucinations and worsening gait freezing. For his gait freezing his mirapex was increased by 0.125 mg every week to a goal dose of 0.75 mg t.i.d. He successfully up titrated the medicine to 0.75/0.625/0.625 but began to have visual hallucinations and confusion so on his neurologist recommended decreasing the dose to 0.625 TID. Despite the changes to his Mirapex the patient s daughter has noted progressive gait stiffness and increased difficulty standing. This has resulted in difficulty with simply getting to the bathroom leading to episodes of incontinence. A UA performed on was reassuring. On the day of presentation to the hospital the patient began to experience visual hallucinations of a motor cross race in his backyard. He subsequently had a fall while transferring from the couch to a chair. His wife was unable to get him off the floor. The fall was witnessed and there was no head strike. Per the patient s wife his gait has acutely worsened over the past 24 hours to the point where he has been unable to ambulate on his own. The patient s daughter called his neurologist who recommended presentation to the ED. In the ED the patient was afebrile HRs normotensive and SpO2 100 RA. On exam he was noted to have cogwheeling of upper extremities and decrease strength. Labs were remarkable for a negative urine and serum tox Na 132 K 5.8 hemolyzed and no EKG changes negative troponin normal LFTs unremarkable CBC. Chest Xray showed no acute process and CTH was reassuring. He was evaluated by neurology who recommended admission to medicine for failure to thrive to continue the patient s home medications and complete a toxo metabolic workup. The patient was given his home pramipexole and pravastatin before he was admitted. On arrival to the floor the patient is comfortable in bed. He is not accompanied by family on my interview.

Goals of care: The patient expressed that her desire to let go and be at peace. She is tired of fighting her end stage liver disease and does not feel that she has a good quality of life. She wished to meet with a representative from hospice which we were able to arrange and she decided that she would like to go home with hospice. A conversation was held with the patient regarding code status. She noted that she would probably be DNR/DNI but would like to discuss it with her son HCP . Therefore at this time she remains full code. We also discussed the possibility of her getting a pleurex catheter placed because of her repeated paracenteses. She was discharged to home with hospice on . Decompensated HCV cirrhosis with ascites: The patient presented with worsening ascites. Her pain was initially managed with tramadol and morphine. She underwent paracentesis on with removal of 3.5L and she received albumin. Studies on the fluid were negative and she reported a significant improvement in her pain. Hyperkalemia: During her hospitalization it was noted that she had hyperkalemia 5.3 5.9 6.9 without EKG changes. After treatment with calcium gluconate 2gm x2 insulin and D50 x 2 and kayexelate her K downtrended to 5.4. Her K has been persistently elevated in the past and should continue to be monitored. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient s mental status was A Ox3 on admission. She was continued on rifaximin and lactulose in house and at discharge. CHRONIC ISSUES Hyponatremia The patient has a history of asymptomatic hyponatremia. It is most likely hypervolemic hyponatremia related to underlying liver disease as well as aldosterone axis dysfunction related to liver disease. She remained asymptomatic through her hospitalization. Because she was also started on 10mg of furosemide to help prevent fluid re accumulation she will require BMPs twice weekly in the outpatient setting. HIV: Emtricitabine Tenofovir Truvada and Raltegravir were continued in house and at discharge. COPD: fluticasone tiotropium and albuterol were continued in house and at discharge. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES Follow up peritoneal fluid culture New/changed medications: Furosemide 10mg daily new For hyperkalemia and hyponatremia the patient should have biweekly BMPs script written .

Chief Complaint: Visual hallucinations Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: N/A History of Present Illness: male with disease dyslipidemia and a history of prostate cancer s/p prostatectomy who was referred to the ED by his neurologist for worsening gait falls and visual hallucinations. The following history is taken from chart review: The patient was seen by his neurologist on at which time he was noted to have visual hallucinations and worsening gait freezing. For his gait freezing his mirapex was increased by 0.125 mg every week to a goal dose of 0.75 mg t.i.d. He successfully up titrated the medicine to 0.75/0.625/0.625 but began to have visual hallucinations and confusion so on his neurologist recommended decreasing the dose to 0.625 TID. Despite the changes to his Mirapex the patient s daughter has noted progressive gait stiffness and increased difficulty standing. This has resulted in difficulty with simply getting to the bathroom leading to episodes of incontinence. A UA performed on was reassuring. On the day of presentation to the hospital the patient began to experience visual hallucinations of a motor cross race in his backyard. He subsequently had a fall while transferring from the couch to a chair. His wife was unable to get him off the floor. The fall was witnessed and there was no head strike. Per the patient s wife his gait has acutely worsened over the past 24 hours to the point where he has been unable to ambulate on his own. The patient s daughter called his neurologist who recommended presentation to the ED. In the ED the patient was afebrile HRs normotensive and SpO2 100 RA. On exam he was noted to have cogwheeling of upper extremities and decrease strength. Labs were remarkable for a negative urine and serum tox Na 132 K 5.8 hemolyzed and no EKG changes negative troponin normal LFTs unremarkable CBC. Chest Xray showed no acute process and CTH was reassuring. He was evaluated by neurology who recommended admission to medicine for failure to thrive to continue the patient s home medications and complete a toxo metabolic workup. The patient was given his home pramipexole and pravastatin before he was admitted. On arrival to the floor the patient is comfortable in bed. He is not accompanied by family on my interview. He knows that he is in the hospital and that it is . He is not sure why he is here and begins to tell me about a party in his house with a motor cross race in his backyard. When I asked him about his fall he mentions that he has not had a fall for years. He denies any fevers chills cough chest pain abdominal pain nausea diarrhea or dysuria.

Chief Complaint: Right flank bruising and pain s/p fall Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None History of Present Illness: Mr. is a with history of factor VIII deficiency who presents with right neck swelling after snowboarding accident. The patient reports that he fell while snowboarding with loss of consciousness on . He was initially seen at where CT imaging of head/neck showed no intracranial hemorrhage. A CTA neck showed a thickened right platysma muscle with surrounding hematoma and a focus of active contrast extravasation within the right platysma muscle. He also developed a right shoulder hematoma although shoulder plain films didn t show acute abnormality. He was seen by Hematology and gave him one dose of DDAVP IV. A factor VIII assay was 139 and vW level was 200 per report. Per report his hemoglobin decreased from 13.2 on to 11.6 on . Repeat imaging in the morning showed stable injuries. The patient saw his hematologist on and was found to have a hemoglobin of 10.4. Because of the continued mild decrease the patient followed up with his PCP at which time his hemoglobin was 9.9. He was found to have an enlarging flank hematoma thus was referred given concern for retroperitoneal bleed. The patient has been using DDAVP intranasally intermittently since the accident. He denies lightheadedness or palpitations any increase in neck swelling over the course of the week. He does endorse pain in his right shoulder resting moving though this has improved over the course of the week. In the ED initial vital signs were 99.2 87 124/75 18 100 /RA. Initial labs demonstrated hemoglobin 10.6 though repeat was 9.7. Chemistries and coags were unremarkable. FVIII activity was 103. A CTAP was performed which demonstrated muscular hemorrhage along the flank but no retroperitoneal bleed on preliminary read. The patient s outpatient hematologist Dr. was contacted and it was decided to give the patient desmopressin 0.3mg/kg IV. The patient was then admitted for futher management. Per review of records the patient has a history of significant bleeding after his circumcision requiring blood transfusion. Throughout childhood he also had a tendency to bruise easily. He was tested and found to have disease. Later after wisdom tooth extraction the patient experienced late e.g. days later bleeding despite treatment with DDAVP. The patient was retested by a hematologist associated with the and was diagnosed with hemophilia A. His FVIII activity has been checked on multiple occasions sometimes testing normal though has been as low as 50. Upon arrival to the floor the patient is comfortable without complaint.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. is a with history of mild FVIII deficiency who presents after snowboarding accident with multiple hematomas and falling hemoglobin concerning for ongoing bleeding. FACTOR VIII DEFICIENCY MULTIPLE HEMATOMAS: Patient presented after recent snowboarding accident. At imaging was notable for neck and shoulder hematomas. Upon reevaluation by his PCP the patient was found to have a flank hematoma. Given falling hemoglobin there was concern for retroperitoneal bleed. CTAP in the ED demonstrated hematoma over his flank musculature but no active extravasation. He was given IV DDAVP but FVIII activity was 103 wnl . CBC remained stable and patient declined further inpatient monitoring. Atrius hematology recommended continued outpatient hemoglobin monitoring but did not think further DDAVP was indicated given normal FVIII level.

Goals of care: The patient expressed that her desire to let go and be at peace. She is tired of fighting her end stage liver disease and does not feel that she has a good quality of life. She wished to meet with a representative from hospice which we were able to arrange and she decided that she would like to go home with hospice. A conversation was held with the patient regarding code status. She noted that she would probably be DNR/DNI but would like to discuss it with her son HCP . Therefore at this time she remains full code. We also discussed the possibility of her getting a pleurex catheter placed because of her repeated paracenteses. She was discharged to home with hospice on . Decompensated HCV cirrhosis with ascites: The patient presented with worsening ascites. Her pain was initially managed with tramadol and morphine. She underwent paracentesis on with removal of 3.5L and she received albumin. Studies on the fluid were negative and she reported a significant improvement in her pain. Hyperkalemia: During her hospitalization it was noted that she had hyperkalemia 5.3 5.9 6.9 without EKG changes. After treatment with calcium gluconate 2gm x2 insulin and D50 x 2 and kayexelate her K downtrended to 5.4. Her K has been persistently elevated in the past and should continue to be monitored. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient s mental status was A Ox3 on admission. She was continued on rifaximin and lactulose in house and at discharge. CHRONIC ISSUES Hyponatremia The patient has a history of asymptomatic hyponatremia. It is most likely hypervolemic hyponatremia related to underlying liver disease as well as aldosterone axis dysfunction related to liver disease. She remained asymptomatic through her hospitalization. Because she was also started on 10mg of furosemide to help prevent fluid re accumulation she will require BMPs twice weekly in the outpatient setting. HIV: Emtricitabine Tenofovir Truvada and Raltegravir were continued in house and at discharge. COPD: fluticasone tiotropium and albuterol were continued in house and at discharge. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES Follow up peritoneal fluid culture New/changed medications: Furosemide 10mg daily new For hyperkalemia and hyponatremia the patient should have biweekly BMPs script written . If K 5.3 she should be given kayexelate once weekly. Lab results will be faxed/sent to Dr. . Continue conversation regarding pleurex catheter placement and code status. She will continue to have twice weekly paracenteses Code: full Emergency Contact: on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1. Calcium Carbonate 500 mg PO BID 2.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service Facility: Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS Decompensated HCV cirrhosis Hyperkalemia SECONDARY DIAGNOSES HIV COPD Hyponatremia Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory Independent. Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. It was a pleasure caring for you during your stay at . You were admitted because of worsening abdominal pain. It is likely that this pain was due to increasing fluid in the abdomen from your cirrhosis. After a paracentesis in which much of this fluid was removed your pain improved significantly. You were noted to have a high potassium during your hospitalization which came down with treatment but this should continue to be followed as an outpatient. You also emphasized your desire to speak with a representative from hospice. Because of your repeated paracenteses we also discussed the possibility of a pleurex catheter placement. We arranged for you to meet with hospice coordinators and you will be discharged home with hospice. We wish you all the best Your care team Followup Instructions:\n",

Chief Complaint: Visual hallucinations Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: N/A History of Present Illness: male with disease dyslipidemia and a history of prostate cancer s/p prostatectomy who was referred to the ED by his neurologist for worsening gait falls and visual hallucinations. The following history is taken from chart review: The patient was seen by his neurologist on at which time he was noted to have visual hallucinations and worsening gait freezing. For his gait freezing his mirapex was increased by 0.125 mg every week to a goal dose of 0.75 mg t.i.d. He successfully up titrated the medicine to 0.75/0.625/0.625 but began to have visual hallucinations and confusion so on his neurologist recommended decreasing the dose to 0.625 TID. Despite the changes to his Mirapex the patient s daughter has noted progressive gait stiffness and increased difficulty standing. This has resulted in difficulty with simply getting to the bathroom leading to episodes of incontinence. A UA performed on was reassuring. On the day of presentation to the hospital the patient began to experience visual hallucinations of a motor cross race in his backyard. He subsequently had a fall while transferring from the couch to a chair. His wife was unable to get him off the floor. The fall was witnessed and there was no head strike. Per the patient s wife his gait has acutely worsened over the past 24 hours to the point where he has been unable to ambulate on his own. The patient s daughter called his neurologist who recommended presentation to the ED. In the ED the patient was afebrile HRs normotensive and SpO2 100 RA. On exam he was noted to have cogwheeling of upper extremities and decrease strength. Labs were remarkable for a negative urine and serum tox Na 132 K 5.8 hemolyzed and no EKG changes negative troponin normal LFTs unremarkable CBC. Chest Xray showed no acute process and CTH was reassuring. He was evaluated by neurology who recommended admission to medicine for failure to thrive to continue the patient s home medications and complete a toxo metabolic workup. The patient was given his home pramipexole and pravastatin before he was admitted. On arrival to the floor the patient is comfortable in bed. He is not accompanied by family on my interview. He knows that he is in the hospital and that it is . He is not sure why he is here and begins to tell me about a party in his house with a motor cross race in his backyard. When I asked him about his fall he mentions that he has not had a fall for years. He denies any fevers chills cough chest pain abdominal pain nausea diarrhea or dysuria.

Chief Complaint: Right flank bruising and pain s/p fall Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None History of Present Illness: Mr. is a with history of factor VIII deficiency who presents with right neck swelling after snowboarding accident. The patient reports that he fell while snowboarding with loss of consciousness on . He was initially seen at where CT imaging of head/neck showed no intracranial hemorrhage. A CTA neck showed a thickened right platysma muscle with surrounding hematoma and a focus of active contrast extravasation within the right platysma muscle. He also developed a right shoulder hematoma although shoulder plain films didn t show acute abnormality. He was seen by Hematology and gave him one dose of DDAVP IV. A factor VIII assay was 139 and vW level was 200 per report. Per report his hemoglobin decreased from 13.2 on to 11.6 on . Repeat imaging in the morning showed stable injuries. The patient saw his hematologist on and was found to have a hemoglobin of 10.4. Because of the continued mild decrease the patient followed up with his PCP at which time his hemoglobin was 9.9. He was found to have an enlarging flank hematoma thus was referred given concern for retroperitoneal bleed. The patient has been using DDAVP intranasally intermittently since the accident. He denies lightheadedness or palpitations any increase in neck swelling over the course of the week. He does endorse pain in his right shoulder resting moving though this has improved over the course of the week. In the ED initial vital signs were 99.2 87 124/75 18 100 /RA. Initial labs demonstrated hemoglobin 10.6 though repeat was 9.7. Chemistries and coags were unremarkable. FVIII activity was 103. A CTAP was performed which demonstrated muscular hemorrhage along the flank but no retroperitoneal bleed on preliminary read. The patient s outpatient hematologist Dr. was contacted and it was decided to give the patient desmopressin 0.3mg/kg IV. The patient was then admitted for futher management. Per review of records the patient has a history of significant bleeding after his circumcision requiring blood transfusion. Throughout childhood he also had a tendency to bruise easily. He was tested and found to have disease. Later after wisdom tooth extraction the patient experienced late e.g. days later bleeding despite treatment with DDAVP. The patient was retested by a hematologist associated with the and was diagnosed with hemophilia A. His FVIII activity has been checked on multiple occasions sometimes testing normal though has been as low as 50. Upon arrival to the floor the patient is comfortable without complaint.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr. is a with history of mild FVIII deficiency who presents after snowboarding accident with multiple hematomas and falling hemoglobin concerning for ongoing bleeding. FACTOR VIII DEFICIENCY MULTIPLE HEMATOMAS: Patient presented after recent snowboarding accident. At imaging was notable for neck and shoulder hematomas. Upon reevaluation by his PCP the patient was found to have a flank hematoma. Given falling hemoglobin there was concern for retroperitoneal bleed. CTAP in the ED demonstrated hematoma over his flank musculature but no active extravasation. He was given IV DDAVP but FVIII activity was 103 wnl . CBC remained stable and patient declined further inpatient monitoring. Atrius hematology recommended continued outpatient hemoglobin monitoring but did not think further DDAVP was indicated given normal FVIII level.

Goals of care: The patient expressed that her desire to let go and be at peace. She is tired of fighting her end stage liver disease and does not feel that she has a good quality of life. She wished to meet with a representative from hospice which we were able to arrange and she decided that she would like to go home with hospice. A conversation was held with the patient regarding code status. She noted that she would probably be DNR/DNI but would like to discuss it with her son HCP . Therefore at this time she remains full code. We also discussed the possibility of her getting a pleurex catheter placed because of her repeated paracenteses. She was discharged to home with hospice on . Decompensated HCV cirrhosis with ascites: The patient presented with worsening ascites. Her pain was initially managed with tramadol and morphine. She underwent paracentesis on with removal of 3.5L and she received albumin. Studies on the fluid were negative and she reported a significant improvement in her pain. Hyperkalemia: During her hospitalization it was noted that she had hyperkalemia 5.3 5.9 6.9 without EKG changes. After treatment with calcium gluconate 2gm x2 insulin and D50 x 2 and kayexelate her K downtrended to 5.4. Her K has been persistently elevated in the past and should continue to be monitored. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient s mental status was A Ox3 on admission. She was continued on rifaximin and lactulose in house and at discharge. CHRONIC ISSUES Hyponatremia The patient has a history of asymptomatic hyponatremia. It is most likely hypervolemic hyponatremia related to underlying liver disease as well as aldosterone axis dysfunction related to liver disease. She remained asymptomatic through her hospitalization. Because she was also started on 10mg of furosemide to help prevent fluid re accumulation she will require BMPs twice weekly in the outpatient setting. HIV: Emtricitabine Tenofovir Truvada and Raltegravir were continued in house and at discharge. COPD: fluticasone tiotropium and albuterol were continued in house and at discharge. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES Follow up peritoneal fluid culture New/changed medications: Furosemide 10mg daily new For hyperkalemia and hyponatremia the patient should have biweekly BMPs script written .

Chief Complaint: Visual hallucinations Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: N/A History of Present Illness: male with disease dyslipidemia and a history of prostate cancer s/p prostatectomy who was referred to the ED by his neurologist for worsening gait falls and visual hallucinations. The following history is taken from chart review: The patient was seen by his neurologist on at which time he was noted to have visual hallucinations and worsening gait freezing. For his gait freezing his mirapex was increased by 0.125 mg every week to a goal dose of 0.75 mg t.i.d. He successfully up titrated the medicine to 0.75/0.625/0.625 but began to have visual hallucinations and confusion so on his neurologist recommended decreasing the dose to 0.625 TID. Despite the changes to his Mirapex the patient s daughter has noted progressive gait stiffness and increased difficulty standing. This has resulted in difficulty with simply getting to the bathroom leading to episodes of incontinence. A UA performed on was reassuring. On the day of presentation to the hospital the patient began to experience visual hallucinations of a motor cross race in his backyard. He subsequently had a fall while transferring from the couch to a chair. His wife was unable to get him off the floor. The fall was witnessed and there was no head strike. Per the patient s wife his gait has acutely worsened over the past 24 hours to the point where he has been unable to ambulate on his own. The patient s daughter called his neurologist who recommended presentation to the ED. In the ED the patient was afebrile HRs normotensive and SpO2 100 RA. On exam he was noted to have cogwheeling of upper extremities and decrease strength. Labs were remarkable for a negative urine and serum tox Na 132 K 5.8 hemolyzed and no EKG changes negative troponin normal LFTs unremarkable CBC. Chest Xray showed no acute process and CTH was reassuring. He was evaluated by neurology who recommended admission to medicine for failure to thrive to continue the patient s home medications and complete a toxo metabolic workup. The patient was given his home pramipexole and pravastatin before he was admitted. On arrival to the floor the patient is comfortable in bed. He is not accompanied by family on my interview. He knows that he is in the hospital and that it is . He is not sure why he is here and begins to tell me about a party in his house with a motor cross race in his backyard. When I asked him about his fall he mentions that he has not had a fall for years. He denies any fevers chills cough chest pain abdominal pain nausea diarrhea or dysuria.

Goals of care: The patient expressed that her desire to let go and be at peace. She is tired of fighting her end stage liver disease and does not feel that she has a good quality of life. She wished to meet with a representative from hospice which we were able to arrange and she decided that she would like to go home with hospice. A conversation was held with the patient regarding code status. She noted that she would probably be DNR/DNI but would like to discuss it with her son HCP . Therefore at this time she remains full code. We also discussed the possibility of her getting a pleurex catheter placed because of her repeated paracenteses. She was discharged to home with hospice on . Decompensated HCV cirrhosis with ascites: The patient presented with worsening ascites. Her pain was initially managed with tramadol and morphine. She underwent paracentesis on with removal of 3.5L and she received albumin. Studies on the fluid were negative and she reported a significant improvement in her pain. Hyperkalemia: During her hospitalization it was noted that she had hyperkalemia 5.3 5.9 6.9 without EKG changes. After treatment with calcium gluconate 2gm x2 insulin and D50 x 2 and kayexelate her K downtrended to 5.4. Her K has been persistently elevated in the past and should continue to be monitored. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient s mental status was A Ox3 on admission. She was continued on rifaximin and lactulose in house and at discharge. CHRONIC ISSUES Hyponatremia The patient has a history of asymptomatic hyponatremia. It is most likely hypervolemic hyponatremia related to underlying liver disease as well as aldosterone axis dysfunction related to liver disease. She remained asymptomatic through her hospitalization. Because she was also started on 10mg of furosemide to help prevent fluid re accumulation she will require BMPs twice weekly in the outpatient setting. HIV: Emtricitabine Tenofovir Truvada and Raltegravir were continued in house and at discharge. COPD: fluticasone tiotropium and albuterol were continued in house and at discharge. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES Follow up peritoneal fluid culture New/changed medications: Furosemide 10mg daily new For hyperkalemia and hyponatremia the patient should have biweekly BMPs script written . If K 5.3 she should be given kayexelate once weekly. Lab results will be faxed/sent to Dr. . Continue conversation regarding pleurex catheter placement and code status. She will continue to have twice weekly paracenteses Code: full Emergency Contact: on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1. Calcium Carbonate 500 mg PO BID 2.

Discharge Disposition: Home With Service Facility: Discharge Diagnosis: PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS Decompensated HCV cirrhosis Hyperkalemia SECONDARY DIAGNOSES HIV COPD Hyponatremia Discharge Condition: Mental Status: Clear and coherent. Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory Independent. Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. It was a pleasure caring for you during your stay at . You were admitted because of worsening abdominal pain. It is likely that this pain was due to increasing fluid in the abdomen from your cirrhosis. After a paracentesis in which much of this fluid was removed your pain improved significantly. You were noted to have a high potassium during your hospitalization which came down with treatment but this should continue to be followed as an outpatient. You also emphasized your desire to speak with a representative from hospice. Because of your repeated paracenteses we also discussed the possibility of a pleurex catheter placement. We arranged for you to meet with hospice coordinators and you will be discharged home with hospice. We wish you all the best Your care team Followup Instructions:</td>\n",

Goals of care: The patient expressed that her desire to let go and be at peace. She is tired of fighting her end stage liver disease and does not feel that she has a good quality of life. She wished to meet with a representative from hospice which we were able to arrange and she decided that she would like to go home with hospice. A conversation was held with the patient regarding code status. She noted that she would probably be DNR/DNI but would like to discuss it with her son HCP . Therefore at this time she remains full code. We also discussed the possibility of her getting a pleurex catheter placed because of her repeated paracenteses. She was discharged to home with hospice on . Decompensated HCV cirrhosis with ascites: The patient presented with worsening ascites. Her pain was initially managed with tramadol and morphine. She underwent paracentesis on with removal of 3.5L and she received albumin. Studies on the fluid were negative and she reported a significant improvement in her pain. Hyperkalemia: During her hospitalization it was noted that she had hyperkalemia 5.3 5.9 6.9 without EKG changes. After treatment with calcium gluconate 2gm x2 insulin and D50 x 2 and kayexelate her K downtrended to 5.4. Her K has been persistently elevated in the past and should continue to be monitored. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient s mental status was A Ox3 on admission. She was continued on rifaximin and lactulose in house and at discharge. CHRONIC ISSUES Hyponatremia The patient has a history of asymptomatic hyponatremia. It is most likely hypervolemic hyponatremia related to underlying liver disease as well as aldosterone axis dysfunction related to liver disease. She remained asymptomatic through her hospitalization. Because she was also started on 10mg of furosemide to help prevent fluid re accumulation she will require BMPs twice weekly in the outpatient setting. HIV: Emtricitabine Tenofovir Truvada and Raltegravir were continued in house and at discharge. COPD: fluticasone tiotropium and albuterol were continued in house and at discharge. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES Follow up peritoneal fluid culture New/changed medications: Furosemide 10mg daily new For hyperkalemia and hyponatremia the patient should have biweekly BMPs script written . If K 5.3 she should be given kayexelate once weekly. Lab results will be faxed/sent to Dr. . Continue conversation regarding pleurex catheter placement and code status.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory Independent. Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms. It was a pleasure caring for you during your stay at . You were admitted because of worsening abdominal pain. It is likely that this pain was due to increasing fluid in the abdomen from your cirrhosis. After a paracentesis in which much of this fluid was removed your pain improved significantly. You were noted to have a high potassium during your hospitalization which came down with treatment but this should continue to be followed as an outpatient. You also emphasized your desire to speak with a representative from hospice. Because of your repeated paracenteses we also discussed the possibility of a pleurex catheter placement.
