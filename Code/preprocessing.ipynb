Chemistries and coags were unremarkable. FVIII activity was \\n103. A CTAP was performed which demonstrated muscular hemorrhage \\nalong the flank, but no retroperitoneal bleed on preliminary \\nread. The patient's outpatient hematologist, Dr. ___, was \\ncontacted and it was decided to give the patient desmopressin \\n0.3mg/kg IV. The patient was then admitted for futher \\nmanagement.  \\nPer review of records, the patient has a history of significant \\nbleeding after his circumcision, requiring blood transfusion. \\nThroughout childhood, he also had a tendency to bruise easily. \\nHe was tested and found to have ___ disease.

The patient reports that he was at \\nthe ___ earlier this afternoon. While coughing, he tripped \\non the curb and suffered trauma to his face. He had no loss of \\nconsciousness. However, he had a persistent nosebleed and \\nappeared to have some trauma to his face, thus was transferred \\nto ___ for further care. There, a CT scan of \\nthe head, neck, and face were remarkable for a nasal bone and \\nseptal fracture. Given persistent epistaxis, bilateral \\nRhinoRockets were placed. He had a small abrasion to the bridge \\nof his nose which was not closed. Bleeding was well controlled. \\nWhile in the OSH ED, he had an episode of nausea and coughed up \\nsome blood. At that time, he began to feel lightheaded and was \\nnoted to be hypotensive and bradycardic. Per report, he had a \\nbrief loss of consciousness, though quickly returned to his \\nbaseline. His family noted that his eyes rolled back into his \\nhead. The patient recalls the event and denies post-event \\nconfusion. He had no further episodes of syncope or hemodynamic \\nchanges.  Given the syncopal event and epistaxis, the patient \\nwas transferred for further care.\\n\\nIn the ED, initial vital signs 98.9 92 140/77 18 100%/RA. Labs \\nwere notable for WBC 11.3 (91%N), H/H 14.1/40.2, plt 147, BUN/Cr \\n36/1.5. HCTs were repeated which were stable. A urinalysis was \\nnegative. A CXR demonstrated a focal consolidation at the left \\nlung base, possibly representing aspiration or developing \\npneumonia. The patient was given Tdap, amoxicillin-clavulanate \\nfor antibiotic prophylaxis, ondansetron, 500cc NS, and \\nmetoprolol tartrate 50mg.

The heart is top normal in size. \\n\\n___ ECHO\\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall \\nthicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional \\nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal apical \\nhypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55 \\n%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right \\nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There \\nare three aortic valve leaflets. There is mild aortic valve \\nstenosis (valve area 1.7cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is \\nseen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial \\nmitral regurgitation is seen.

This \\nwas trended and eventually rose to 1.5, though MB component \\ndowntrended during course of admission. The patient was without \\nchest pain or other cardiac symptoms. Cardiology was consulted \\nwho thought that this was most likely secondary to demand \\nischemia (type II MI) secondary to his fall. An echocardiogram \\ndemonstrated aortic stenosis and likely distal LAD disease based \\non wall motion abnormalities. The patient's metoprolol was \\nuptitrated, his pravastatin was converted to atorvastatin, his \\nclopidogrel was maintained, and he was started on aspirin.\\n\\n#Hypoxemia/L basilar consolidation\\nPatient reported to be mildly hypoxic in the ED, though he \\nmaintained normal oxygen saturations on room air. He denied \\nshortness of breath or cough, fevers, or other infectious \\nsymptoms and had no leukocytosis. A CXR revealed consolidation \\nin left lung, thought to be possibly related to aspirated blood. \\n-monitor O2 saturation, temperature, trend WBC. He was convered \\nwith antibiotics while inpatient as he required prophylaxis for \\nthe Rhinorockets, but this was discontinued upon discharge.\\n\\n#Acute kidney injury\\nPatient presented with creatinine of 1.5 with last creatinine at \\nPCP 1.8. Patient was unaware of a history of kidney disease. The \\npatient was discharged with a stable creatinine.\\n\\n#Peripheral vascular disease\\nPatient had a history of AAA repair in ___ without history of \\nMI per PCP. Patient denied history of CABG or cardiac/peripheral \\nstents.

She is tired of \"fighting\" her end stage  liver disease and does not feel that she has a good quality of  life. She wished to meet with a representative from hospice,  which we were able to arrange, and she decided that she would  like to go home with hospice. A conversation was held with the  patient regarding code status. She noted that she would probably  be DNR/DNI, but would like to discuss it with her son (HCP).  Therefore, at this time, she remains full code. We also  discussed the possibility of her getting a pleurex catheter  placed because of her repeated paracenteses. She was discharged  to home with hospice on ___.  # Decompensated HCV cirrhosis with ascites: The patient  presented with worsening ascites. Her pain was initially managed  with tramadol and morphine. She underwent ___ paracentesis  on ___ with removal of 3.5L and she received albumin. Studies  on the fluid were negative, and she reported a significant  improvement in her pain.   # Hyperkalemia: During her hospitalization, it was noted that  she had hyperkalemia 5.3 -> 5.9 -> 6.9 without EKG changes.  After treatment with calcium gluconate 2gm x2, insulin and D50 x  2, and kayexelate, her K downtrended to 5.4. Her K has been  persistently elevated in the past and should continue to be  monitored.  # Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status was A+Ox3  on admission. She was continued on rifaximin and lactulose  in-house and at discharge.  CHRONIC ISSUES ==============  # Hyponatremia - The patient has a history of asymptomatic  hyponatremia. It is most likely hypervolemic hyponatremia  related to underlying liver disease as well as aldosterone axis  dysfunction related to liver disease. She remained asymptomatic  through her hospitalization.

You  were admitted because of worsening abdominal pain. It is likely  that this pain was due to increasing fluid in the abdomen from  your cirrhosis. After a paracentesis in which much of this fluid  was removed, your pain improved significantly. You were noted to  have a high potassium during your hospitalization, which came  down with treatment but this should continue to be followed as  an outpatient. You also emphasized your desire to speak with a  representative from hospice. Because of your repeated  paracenteses, we also discussed the possibility of a pleurex  catheter placement. We arranged for you to meet with hospice  coordinators, and you will be discharged home with hospice.  We wish you all the best!  Your ___ care team   Followup Instructions: ___ \n",

Chief Complaint: Visual hallucinations   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: N/A    History of Present Illness: ___ male with ___ disease, dyslipidemia, and a history of prostate cancer (s/p prostatectomy) who was referred to the ED by his neurologist for worsening gait, falls, and visual hallucinations.   The following history is taken from chart review:   The patient was seen by his neurologist on ___ at which time he was noted to have visual hallucinations and worsening gait freezing. For his gait freezing, his mirapex was increased by 0.125 mg every week to a goal dose of 0.75 mg t.i.d. He successfully up-titrated the medicine to 0.75/0.625/0.625 but began to have visual hallucinations and confusion so on ___ his neurologist recommended decreasing the dose to 0.625 TID.  Despite the changes to his Mirapex, the patient's daughter has noted progressive gait stiffness and increased difficulty standing. This has resulted in difficulty with simply getting to the bathroom leading to episodes of incontinence. A UA performed on ___ was reassuring.   On the day of presentation to the hospital, the patient began to experience visual hallucinations of a motor cross race in his backyard. He subsequently had a fall while transferring from the couch to a chair. His wife was unable to get him off the floor. The fall was witnessed and there was no head strike. Per the patient's wife, his gait has acutely worsened over the past 24 hours to the point where he has been unable to ambulate on his own. The patient's daughter called his neurologist who recommended presentation to the ED.   In the ED, the patient was afebrile, HRs ___, normotensive, and SpO2 100% RA. On exam he was noted to have cogwheeling of upper extremities and decrease ___ strength. Labs were remarkable for a negative urine and serum tox, Na 132, K 5.8 (hemolyzed and no  EKG changes), negative troponin, normal LFTs, unremarkable CBC.  Chest Xray showed no acute process and CTH was reassuring. He was evaluated by neurology who recommended admission to medicine for failure to thrive, to continue the patient's home medications, and complete a toxo-metabolic workup. The patient was given his home pramipexole and pravastatin before he was admitted.    On arrival to the floor, the patient is comfortable in bed. He  is not accompanied by family on my interview. He knows that he is  in the hospital and that it is ___. He is not sure why he is here and begins to tell me about a party in his house with a motor cross race in his backyard. When I asked him about his fall, he mentions that he has not had a fall for ___ years. He denies any fevers, chills, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, or dysuria.

The patient reports that he fell while snowboarding with loss of  consciousness on ___. He was initially seen at  ___ where CT imaging of head/neck showed no  intracranial hemorrhage. A CTA neck showed a thickened right  platysma muscle with surrounding hematoma and a focus of active  contrast extravasation within the right platysma muscle. He also  developed a right shoulder hematoma although shoulder plain  films didn't show acute abnormality. He was seen by ___  Hematology and gave him one dose of DDAVP IV. A factor VIII  assay was 139 and vW level was >200 per report. Per report, his  hemoglobin decreased from 13.2 on ___ to 11.6 on ___.  Repeat imaging in the morning showed stable injuries. The  patient saw his hematologist on ___ and was found to have a  hemoglobin of 10.4. Because of the continued mild decrease, the  patient followed up with his PCP ___ ___ at which time his  hemoglobin was 9.9. He was found to have an enlarging flank  hematoma, thus was referred given concern for retroperitoneal  bleed. The patient has been using DDAVP intranasally  intermittently since the accident. He denies lightheadedness or  palpitations, any increase in neck swelling over the course of  the week. He does endorse pain in his right shoulder ___  resting, ___ moving), though this has improved over the course  of the week.   In the ED, initial vital signs were 99.2 87 124/75 18 100%/RA.  Initial labs demonstrated hemoglobin 10.6, though repeat was  9.7. Chemistries and coags were unremarkable. FVIII activity was  103. A CTAP was performed which demonstrated muscular hemorrhage  along the flank, but no retroperitoneal bleed on preliminary  read. The patient's outpatient hematologist, Dr. ___, was  contacted and it was decided to give the patient desmopressin  0.3mg/kg IV. The patient was then admitted for futher  management.   Per review of records, the patient has a history of significant  bleeding after his circumcision, requiring blood transfusion.  Throughout childhood, he also had a tendency to bruise easily.  He was tested and found to have ___ disease. Later,  after wisdom tooth extraction, the patient experienced late  (e.g. ___ days later) bleeding despite treatment with DDAVP. The  patient was retested by a hematologist associated with the  ___ and was diagnosed  with hemophilia A. His FVIII activity has been checked on  multiple occasions, sometimes testing normal, though has been as  low as ~50.   Upon arrival to the floor, the patient is comfortable without  complaint.

The patient reports that he was at  the ___ earlier this afternoon. While coughing, he tripped  on the curb and suffered trauma to his face. He had no loss of  consciousness. However, he had a persistent nosebleed and  appeared to have some trauma to his face, thus was transferred  to ___ for further care. There, a CT scan of  the head, neck, and face were remarkable for a nasal bone and  septal fracture. Given persistent epistaxis, bilateral  RhinoRockets were placed. He had a small abrasion to the bridge  of his nose which was not closed. Bleeding was well controlled.  While in the OSH ED, he had an episode of nausea and coughed up  some blood. At that time, he began to feel lightheaded and was  noted to be hypotensive and bradycardic. Per report, he had a  brief loss of consciousness, though quickly returned to his  baseline. His family noted that his eyes rolled back into his  head. The patient recalls the event and denies post-event  confusion. He had no further episodes of syncope or hemodynamic  changes.  Given the syncopal event and epistaxis, the patient  was transferred for further care.  In the ED, initial vital signs 98.9 92 140/77 18 100%/RA. Labs  were notable for WBC 11.3 (91%N), H/H 14.1/40.2, plt 147, BUN/Cr  36/1.5. HCTs were repeated which were stable. A urinalysis was  negative. A CXR demonstrated a focal consolidation at the left  lung base, possibly representing aspiration or developing  pneumonia. The patient was given Tdap, amoxicillin-clavulanate  for antibiotic prophylaxis, ondansetron, 500cc NS, and  metoprolol tartrate 50mg. Clopidogrel was held.

The lungs are  adequately  aerated. There is a focal consolidation at the left lung base  adjacent to the lateral hemidiaphragm. There is mild vascular  engorgement. There is bilateral apical pleural thickening. The  cardiomediastinal silhouette is remarkable for aortic arch  calcifications. The heart is top normal in size.   ___ ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall  thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional  left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal apical  hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55  %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right  ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There  are three aortic valve leaflets. There is mild aortic valve  stenosis (valve area 1.7cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is  seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial  mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic  pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic  pericardial effusion.   IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild  regional systolic dysfunction most c/w CAD (distal LAD  distribution). Mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild aortic  regurgitation.    Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is an ___ with history of AAA s/p repair  complicated by MI, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who  presented with nasal fractures and epistaxis after mechanical  fall with hospital course complicated by NSTEMI.  #Epistaxis, nasal fractures Patient presenting after mechanical fall with Rhinorockets  placed at outside hospital for ongoing epistaxis. CT scan from  that hospital demonstrated nasal bone and septal fractures. The  Rhinorockets were maintained while inpatient and discontinued  prior to discharge. He was encouraged to use oxymetolazone nasal  spray and hold pressure should bleeding reoccur.   #NSTEMI Patient found to have mild elevation of troponin in the ED. This  was trended and eventually rose to 1.5, though MB component  downtrended during course of admission. The patient was without  chest pain or other cardiac symptoms. Cardiology was consulted  who thought that this was most likely secondary to demand  ischemia (type II MI) secondary to his fall. An echocardiogram  demonstrated aortic stenosis and likely distal LAD disease based  on wall motion abnormalities. The patient's metoprolol was  uptitrated, his pravastatin was converted to atorvastatin, his  clopidogrel was maintained, and he was started on aspirin.  #Hypoxemia/L basilar consolidation Patient reported to be mildly hypoxic in the ED, though he  maintained normal oxygen saturations on room air. He denied  shortness of breath or cough, fevers, or other infectious  symptoms and had no leukocytosis. A CXR revealed consolidation  in left lung, thought to be possibly related to aspirated blood.  -monitor O2 saturation, temperature, trend WBC. He was convered  with antibiotics while inpatient as he required prophylaxis for  the Rhinorockets, but this was discontinued upon discharge.  #Acute kidney injury Patient presented with creatinine of 1.5 with last creatinine at  PCP 1.8. Patient was unaware of a history of kidney disease. The  patient was discharged with a stable creatinine.  #Peripheral vascular disease Patient had a history of AAA repair in ___ without history of  MI per PCP. Patient denied history of CABG or cardiac/peripheral  stents. A cardiac regimen was continued, as above.  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES -Outpatient stress echo for futher evaluation distal LAD disease  (possibly a large myocardial territory at risk).  -Repeat echocardiogram in ___ years to monitor mild AS/AR. -If epistaxis returns, can use oxymetolazone nasal spray. -Repeat chest x-ray in ___ weeks to ensure resolution of the LLL  infiltrative process. -Consider follow-up with ENT or Plastic Surgery for later  evaluation of nasal fractures. -Repeat CBC in one week to ensure stability of HCT and  platelets. -Consider conversion of metoprolol tartrate to succinate for  ease-of-administration.

You came to us with  stomach pain and worsening distension. While you were here we  did a paracentesis to remove 1.5L of fluid from your belly. We  also placed you on you 40 mg of Lasix and 50 mg of Aldactone to  help you urinate the excess fluid still in your belly. As we  discussed, everyone has a different dose of lasix required to  make them urinate and it's likely that you weren't taking a high  enough dose. Please take these medications daily to keep excess  fluid off and eat a low salt diet. You will follow up with Dr.      in liver clinic and from there have your colonoscopy  and EGD scheduled. Of course, we are always here if you need us.  We wish you all the best! Your     Team.     Followup Instructions:     \n",

Brief Hospital Course:     with HIV on HAART, HCV cirrhosis with ascites and HE, h/o  IVDU, COPD, bipolar disorder presents with abdominal discomfort  due to     ascites.     # ASCITES. Now diuretic refractory given last tap was three days  ago with 3L removed and she has already built up moderate  ascites. Infectious workup negative, with CXR clear, UA  contaminated but not grossly positive so will f/u culture,  diagnostic para with only 225 WBC, RUQ US with no PV thrombus.  Compliant with diuretics but not following low sodium diet or  fluid restriction. Dr.     discussed possible TIPS in  the office but due to lung disease, that was on hold pending  further cardiac evaluation. Diuretics were recently decreased  due to hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. Held spironolactone for  now due to K 5.2 and increased lasix 20 -> 40. No evidence of  severe hyponatremia (Na<120) or renal failure Cr>2.0 to stop  diuretics at present. Diagnostic paracentesis negative for  infection. Ascitic total protein 0.3 so warrants SBP prophylaxis  (<1.0) and fortunately already on Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis  which would be appropriate for SBP ppx also. Patient did admit  to eating pizza and some     food prior to  admission. She had therapeutic paracentesis with 4.3L removed  and received 37.5G albumin IV post procedure. She felt much  better with resolution of abdominal discomfort. Patient is  scheduled for repeat paracentesis as outpatient on    .    # HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY. History of HE from Hep C cirrhosis.  Now with mild encephalopathy (hallucinations and forgetfulness)  due to medication noncompliance, but not acutely encephalopathic  and without asterixis on exam. Infectious workup negative thus  far. Continue lactulose 30mL TID and titrate to 3 BMs daily and  continue rifaximin 550mg BID.    # HYPONATREMIA. Na 125 on admission, 128 four days ago, and 135  one month ago. Likely due to third spacing from worsening  ascites and fluid overload. 1.5L fluid restriction, low salt  diet. S/p therapeutic paracentesis with albumin replacement.  # CIRRHOSIS, HEPATITIS C. MELD score of 10 and Child's      class B on this admission. Now decompensated due to ascites.  Hepatitis C genotype IIIB. Dr.     starting      and     with patient in clinic and the  insurance process was started by her office. No history of EGD,  needs this as outpatient for varices screening.     # NUTRITION. Unclear if truly compliant with low salt diet. Poor  oral intake. Low albumin 2.8 on admission. Met with nutrition.    # COAGULOPATHY. INR 1.4 four days ago. No evidence of active  bleeding. Very mild thrombocytopenia with plts 143.     # HIV. Most recent CD4 173. On HAART. No established ID  provider. Continue Truvada and Isentress, Bactrim DS daily for  PCP    .

Altered mental status improved with lactulose. Hypotension was  felt to be due to fluid shifts from paracentesis on the day  prior to admission as well as low PO intake in the setting of  AMS. Hypotension and     resolved with IV albumin. Hyperkalemia  resolved with insulin and kayexalate.  # Hypotension: Patient presented with SBP in     and improved  with albumin in the ED to    . It was felt to be due to  fluid shifts from paracentesis on    , as well as likely  hypovolemia given AMS and decreased PO intake. No concern for  bleeding or sepsis with baseline CBC and lack of fever. She  continued to received IV albumin during her hospital course,  with which her SBP improved to     and patient remained  asymptomatic.    # Hyperkalemia: Patient presented with K 6.7 with EKG changes.  Given low Na, likely the result of low effective arterial volume  leading to poor K excretion, with likely exacerbation from    .  AM cortisol was normal.

They  discussed that the patient is not a transplant candidate  givenevere underlying lung disease (FEV1 ~0.8), hypoxia, RV  dilation and very low BMI. A more conservative approach was  recommended and the patient was transitioned to DNR/DNI. The  patient agreed with this plan. She was treated with the goal of  treating any any correctable issues. Social work met with the  patient prior to discharge. The patient was interested in  following up with palliative care, for which an outpatient  referral was made.    # Altered Mental Status: Patient presented with confusion that  was most likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. Based on  outpatient records, patient has had steady decline in  decompensated cirrhosis and mental status. No signs of infection  and head CT was negative as well. Mental status improved with  lactulose in the ED and patient reports that she has not been  taking lactulose regularly at home. Patient was also continued  on rifaximin.     # HCV Cirrhosis: Genotype 3a. Patient is decompensated with  increasing ascites and worsening hepatic encephalopathy. She is  dependent on twice weekly paracentesis. Spironolactone was  recently stopped due to hyperkalemia. Patient is not a  transplant candidate given her comorbidities COPD per outpatient  hepatologist.

She is tired of \"fighting\" her end stage  liver disease and does not feel that she has a good quality of  life. She wished to meet with a representative from hospice,  which we were able to arrange, and she decided that she would  like to go home with hospice. A conversation was held with the  patient regarding code status. She noted that she would probably  be DNR/DNI, but would like to discuss it with her son (HCP).  Therefore, at this time, she remains full code. We also  discussed the possibility of her getting a pleurex catheter  placed because of her repeated paracenteses. She was discharged  to home with hospice on    .  # Decompensated HCV cirrhosis with ascites: The patient  presented with worsening ascites. Her pain was initially managed  with tramadol and morphine. She underwent     paracentesis  on     with removal of 3.5L and she received albumin. Studies  on the fluid were negative, and she reported a significant  improvement in her pain.   # Hyperkalemia: During her hospitalization, it was noted that  she had hyperkalemia 5.3 -> 5.9 -> 6.9 without EKG changes.  After treatment with calcium gluconate 2gm x2, insulin and D50 x  2, and kayexelate, her K downtrended to 5.4. Her K has been  persistently elevated in the past and should continue to be  monitored.  # Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status was A+Ox3  on admission. She was continued on rifaximin and lactulose  in-house and at discharge.  CHRONIC ISSUES ==============  # Hyponatremia - The patient has a history of asymptomatic  hyponatremia. It is most likely hypervolemic hyponatremia  related to underlying liver disease as well as aldosterone axis  dysfunction related to liver disease. She remained asymptomatic  through her hospitalization. Because she was also started on  10mg of furosemide to help prevent fluid re-accumulation, she  will require BMPs twice weekly in the outpatient setting.  # HIV: Emtricitabine-Tenofovir (Truvada) and Raltegravir were  continued in-house and at discharge.    # COPD: fluticasone, tiotropium and albuterol were continued  in-house and at discharge.  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES =================== [ ] Follow-up peritoneal fluid culture [ ] New/changed medications: Furosemide 10mg daily (new) [ ] For hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, the patient should have  biweekly BMPs (script written). If K > 5.3, she should be given  kayexelate once weekly. Lab results will be faxed/sent to Dr.     . [ ] Continue conversation regarding pleurex catheter placement  and code status. [ ] She will continue to have twice weekly paracenteses  # Code: full   # Emergency Contact:                on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1.

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.    Discharge Instructions: Dear Ms.    ,  It was a pleasure caring for you during your stay at    . You  were admitted because of worsening abdominal pain. It is likely  that this pain was due to increasing fluid in the abdomen from  your cirrhosis. After a paracentesis in which much of this fluid  was removed, your pain improved significantly. You were noted to  have a high potassium during your hospitalization, which came  down with treatment but this should continue to be followed as  an outpatient. You also emphasized your desire to speak with a  representative from hospice. Because of your repeated  paracenteses, we also discussed the possibility of a pleurex  catheter placement. We arranged for you to meet with hospice  coordinators, and you will be discharged home with hospice.  We wish you all the best!  Your     care team   Followup Instructions:     \n",

Chief Complaint: Visual hallucinations   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: N/A    History of Present Illness:     male with     disease, dyslipidemia, and a history of prostate cancer (s/p prostatectomy) who was referred to the ED by his neurologist for worsening gait, falls, and visual hallucinations.   The following history is taken from chart review:   The patient was seen by his neurologist on     at which time he was noted to have visual hallucinations and worsening gait freezing. For his gait freezing, his mirapex was increased by 0.125 mg every week to a goal dose of 0.75 mg t.i.d. He successfully up-titrated the medicine to 0.75/0.625/0.625 but began to have visual hallucinations and confusion so on     his neurologist recommended decreasing the dose to 0.625 TID.  Despite the changes to his Mirapex, the patient's daughter has noted progressive gait stiffness and increased difficulty standing. This has resulted in difficulty with simply getting to the bathroom leading to episodes of incontinence. A UA performed on     was reassuring.   On the day of presentation to the hospital, the patient began to experience visual hallucinations of a motor cross race in his backyard. He subsequently had a fall while transferring from the couch to a chair. His wife was unable to get him off the floor. The fall was witnessed and there was no head strike. Per the patient's wife, his gait has acutely worsened over the past 24 hours to the point where he has been unable to ambulate on his own. The patient's daughter called his neurologist who recommended presentation to the ED.   In the ED, the patient was afebrile, HRs    , normotensive, and SpO2 100% RA. On exam he was noted to have cogwheeling of upper extremities and decrease     strength. Labs were remarkable for a negative urine and serum tox, Na 132, K 5.8 (hemolyzed and no  EKG changes), negative troponin, normal LFTs, unremarkable CBC.  Chest Xray showed no acute process and CTH was reassuring. He was evaluated by neurology who recommended admission to medicine for failure to thrive, to continue the patient's home medications, and complete a toxo-metabolic workup. The patient was given his home pramipexole and pravastatin before he was admitted.    On arrival to the floor, the patient is comfortable in bed. He  is not accompanied by family on my interview. He knows that he is  in the hospital and that it is    . He is not sure why he is here and begins to tell me about a party in his house with a motor cross race in his backyard. When I asked him about his fall, he mentions that he has not had a fall for     years. He denies any fevers, chills, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, or dysuria.

The patient was found  to have a left valgus impacted femoral neck fracture and was  admitted to the orthopedic surgery service. The patient was  taken to the operating room on     for left closed reduction  and percutaneous pinning of hip, which the patient tolerated  well. For full details of the procedure please see the  separately dictated operative report. The patient was taken from  the OR to the PACU in stable condition and after satisfactory  recovery from anesthesia was transferred to the floor. The  patient was initially given IV fluids and IV pain medications,  and progressed to a regular diet and oral medications by POD#1.  The patient was given     antibiotics and  anticoagulation per routine. The patient's home medications were  continued throughout this hospitalization. The patient worked  with     who determined that discharge to home with services was  appropriate. The     hospital course was otherwise  unremarkable.  At the time of discharge the patient's pain was well controlled  with oral medications, incisions were clean/dry/intact, and the  patient was voiding/moving bowels spontaneously. The patient is   weightbearing as tolerated in the left lower extremity, and will  be discharged on Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis. The patient will  follow up with Dr.     routine. A thorough discussion  was had with the patient regarding the diagnosis and expected  post-discharge course including reasons to call the office or  return to the hospital, and all questions were answered. The  patient was also given written instructions concerning  precautionary instructions and the appropriate follow-up care.  The patient expressed readiness for discharge.

Discharge Instructions: INSTRUCTIONS AFTER ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY:  - You were in the hospital for orthopedic surgery. It is normal  to feel tired or \"washed out\" after surgery, and this feeling  should improve over the first few days to week.  - Resume your regular activities as tolerated, but please follow  your weight bearing precautions strictly at all times.  ACTIVITY AND WEIGHT BEARING: - Weightbearing as tolerated left lower extremity  MEDICATIONS:   1)  Take Tylenol     every 6 hours around the clock. This is  an over the counter medication.   2)  Add oxycodone as needed for increased pain. Aim to wean  off this medication in 1 week or sooner.  This is an example on  how to wean down: Take 1 tablet every 3 hours as needed x 1 day, then 1 tablet every 4 hours as needed x 1 day, then 1 tablet every 6 hours as needed x 1 day, then 1 tablet every 8 hours as needed x 2 days,  then 1 tablet every 12 hours as needed x 1 day, then 1 tablet every before bedtime as needed x 1 day.   Then continue with Tylenol for pain.   3)  Do not stop the Tylenol until you are off of the narcotic  medication.   4)  Per state regulations, we are limited in the amount of  narcotics we can prescribe. If you require more, you must  contact the office to set up an appointment because we cannot  refill this type of pain medication over the phone.    5)  Narcotic pain relievers can cause constipation, so you  should drink eight 8oz glasses of water daily and continue  following the bowel regimen as stated on your medication  prescription list.

Chief Complaint: Right flank bruising and pain s/p fall   Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None    History of Present Illness: Mr.     is a     with history of factor VIII deficiency who  presents with right neck swelling after snowboarding accident.  The patient reports that he fell while snowboarding with loss of  consciousness on    . He was initially seen at      where CT imaging of head/neck showed no  intracranial hemorrhage. A CTA neck showed a thickened right  platysma muscle with surrounding hematoma and a focus of active  contrast extravasation within the right platysma muscle. He also  developed a right shoulder hematoma although shoulder plain  films didn't show acute abnormality. He was seen by      Hematology and gave him one dose of DDAVP IV. A factor VIII  assay was 139 and vW level was >200 per report. Per report, his  hemoglobin decreased from 13.2 on     to 11.6 on    .  Repeat imaging in the morning showed stable injuries. The  patient saw his hematologist on     and was found to have a  hemoglobin of 10.4. Because of the continued mild decrease, the  patient followed up with his PCP         at which time his  hemoglobin was 9.9. He was found to have an enlarging flank  hematoma, thus was referred given concern for retroperitoneal  bleed. The patient has been using DDAVP intranasally  intermittently since the accident. He denies lightheadedness or  palpitations, any increase in neck swelling over the course of  the week. He does endorse pain in his right shoulder      resting,     moving), though this has improved over the course  of the week.   In the ED, initial vital signs were 99.2 87 124/75 18 100%/RA.  Initial labs demonstrated hemoglobin 10.6, though repeat was  9.7. Chemistries and coags were unremarkable. FVIII activity was  103. A CTAP was performed which demonstrated muscular hemorrhage  along the flank, but no retroperitoneal bleed on preliminary  read. The patient's outpatient hematologist, Dr.    , was  contacted and it was decided to give the patient desmopressin  0.3mg/kg IV. The patient was then admitted for futher  management.   Per review of records, the patient has a history of significant  bleeding after his circumcision, requiring blood transfusion.  Throughout childhood, he also had a tendency to bruise easily.  He was tested and found to have     disease. Later,  after wisdom tooth extraction, the patient experienced late  (e.g.     days later) bleeding despite treatment with DDAVP. The  patient was retested by a hematologist associated with the      and was diagnosed  with hemophilia A. His FVIII activity has been checked on  multiple occasions, sometimes testing normal, though has been as  low as ~50.   Upon arrival to the floor, the patient is comfortable without  complaint.

Brief Hospital Course: Mr.     is a     with history of mild FVIII deficiency who  presents after snowboarding accident with multiple hematomas and  falling hemoglobin concerning for ongoing bleeding.  # FACTOR VIII DEFICIENCY, MULTIPLE HEMATOMAS: Patient presented  after recent snowboarding accident. At         , imaging was notable for neck and shoulder hematomas.  Upon reevaluation by his PCP, the patient was found to have a  flank hematoma. Given falling hemoglobin, there was concern for  retroperitoneal bleed. CTAP in the ED demonstrated hematoma over  his flank musculature, but no active extravasation. He was given  IV DDAVP, but FVIII activity was 103 (wnl). CBC remained stable  and patient declined further inpatient monitoring. Atrius  hematology recommended continued outpatient hemoglobin  monitoring, but did not think further DDAVP was indicated given  normal FVIII level.      # TRANISTIONAL ISSUES: - PCP         - CBC     -     at     - Caution to avoid dangerous activity - Code: presumed full   - Emergency Contact:         - wife)    Medications on Admission: The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete. 1.

You were admitted with bruising on your right  side and low blood counts after a snowboarding fall. With your  history of hemophilia, it was important to evaluate internal  bleeding which did show a right muscular flank blood collection.  Your facotr VIII level was 103 and you received IV DDAVP under  our care. Your blood counts were stable to improved on the day  of admission.   It is important that you not participate in any dangerous  activities given your recent bleed and your hemophilia. Bleeding  in hemophiliacs has more potential to be life-threatening.  Please get your blood counts checked at     site on either      or    . Follow up with your  regular doctor early next week.  Best wishes, Your     Care Team   Followup Instructions:     \n",

The patient reports that he was at  the     earlier this afternoon. While coughing, he tripped  on the curb and suffered trauma to his face. He had no loss of  consciousness. However, he had a persistent nosebleed and  appeared to have some trauma to his face, thus was transferred  to     for further care. There, a CT scan of  the head, neck, and face were remarkable for a nasal bone and  septal fracture. Given persistent epistaxis, bilateral  RhinoRockets were placed. He had a small abrasion to the bridge  of his nose which was not closed. Bleeding was well controlled.  While in the OSH ED, he had an episode of nausea and coughed up  some blood. At that time, he began to feel lightheaded and was  noted to be hypotensive and bradycardic. Per report, he had a  brief loss of consciousness, though quickly returned to his  baseline. His family noted that his eyes rolled back into his  head. The patient recalls the event and denies post-event  confusion. He had no further episodes of syncope or hemodynamic  changes.  Given the syncopal event and epistaxis, the patient  was transferred for further care.  In the ED, initial vital signs 98.9 92 140/77 18 100%/RA. Labs  were notable for WBC 11.3 (91%N), H/H 14.1/40.2, plt 147, BUN/Cr  36/1.5. HCTs were repeated which were stable. A urinalysis was  negative. A CXR demonstrated a focal consolidation at the left  lung base, possibly representing aspiration or developing  pneumonia.

The lungs are  adequately  aerated. There is a focal consolidation at the left lung base  adjacent to the lateral hemidiaphragm. There is mild vascular  engorgement. There is bilateral apical pleural thickening. The  cardiomediastinal silhouette is remarkable for aortic arch  calcifications. The heart is top normal in size.       ECHO The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall  thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional  left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal apical  hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55  %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right  ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There  are three aortic valve leaflets. There is mild aortic valve  stenosis (valve area 1.7cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is  seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial  mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic  pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic  pericardial effusion.   IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild  regional systolic dysfunction most c/w CAD (distal LAD  distribution). Mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild aortic  regurgitation.    Brief Hospital Course: Mr.     is an     with history of AAA s/p repair  complicated by MI, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who  presented with nasal fractures and epistaxis after mechanical  fall with hospital course complicated by NSTEMI.  #Epistaxis, nasal fractures Patient presenting after mechanical fall with Rhinorockets  placed at outside hospital for ongoing epistaxis. CT scan from  that hospital demonstrated nasal bone and septal fractures. The  Rhinorockets were maintained while inpatient and discontinued  prior to discharge. He was encouraged to use oxymetolazone nasal  spray and hold pressure should bleeding reoccur.   #NSTEMI Patient found to have mild elevation of troponin in the ED. This  was trended and eventually rose to 1.5, though MB component  downtrended during course of admission. The patient was without  chest pain or other cardiac symptoms. Cardiology was consulted  who thought that this was most likely secondary to demand  ischemia (type II MI) secondary to his fall. An echocardiogram  demonstrated aortic stenosis and likely distal LAD disease based  on wall motion abnormalities. The patient's metoprolol was  uptitrated, his pravastatin was converted to atorvastatin, his  clopidogrel was maintained, and he was started on aspirin.  #Hypoxemia/L basilar consolidation Patient reported to be mildly hypoxic in the ED, though he  maintained normal oxygen saturations on room air. He denied  shortness of breath or cough, fevers, or other infectious  symptoms and had no leukocytosis. A CXR revealed consolidation  in left lung, thought to be possibly related to aspirated blood.  -monitor O2 saturation, temperature, trend WBC. He was convered  with antibiotics while inpatient as he required prophylaxis for  the Rhinorockets, but this was discontinued upon discharge.  #Acute kidney injury Patient presented with creatinine of 1.5 with last creatinine at  PCP 1.8. Patient was unaware of a history of kidney disease. The  patient was discharged with a stable creatinine.  #Peripheral vascular disease Patient had a history of AAA repair in     without history of  MI per PCP. Patient denied history of CABG or cardiac/peripheral  stents. A cardiac regimen was continued, as above.  TRANSITIONAL ISSUES -Outpatient stress echo for futher evaluation distal LAD disease  (possibly a large myocardial territory at risk).  -Repeat echocardiogram in     years to monitor mild AS/AR. -If epistaxis returns, can use oxymetolazone nasal spray. -Repeat chest x-ray in     weeks to ensure resolution of the LLL  infiltrative process. -Consider follow-up with ENT or Plastic Surgery for later  evaluation of nasal fractures. -Repeat CBC in one week to ensure stability of HCT and  platelets. -Consider conversion of metoprolol tartrate to succinate for  ease-of-administration.

still in your belly. as we discussed everyone has a different dose of lasix required to make them urinate and its likely that you werent taking a high enough dose. please take these medications daily to keep excess fluid off and eat a low salt diet. you will follow up with dr. in liver clinic and from there have your colonoscopy and egd scheduled. of course we are always here if you need us. we

to have a high potassium during your hospitalization which came down with treatment but this should continue to be followed as an outpatient. you also emphasized your desire to speak with a representative from hospice. because of your repeated paracenteses we also discussed the possibility of a pleurex catheter placement. we arranged for you to meet with hospice coordinators and you will be discharged home with hospice. we wish you all the best your care team followup instructions\n",

visual hallucinations. the following history is taken from chart review the patient was seen by his neurologist on at which time he was noted to have visual hallucinations and worsening gait freezing. for his gait freezing his mirapex was increased by 0.125 mg every week to a goal dose of 0.75 mg t.i.d. he successfully uptitrated the medicine to 0.75/0.625/0.625 but began to have visual hallucinations and confusion so on his neurologist recommended decreasing the dose to 0.625 tid. despite the changes to his mirapex the patients daughter has noted progressive gait stiffness and increased difficulty standing. this has resulted in difficulty with simply getting to the bathroom leading to episodes of incontinence. a ua performed on was reassuring. on the day of presentation to
